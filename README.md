Android app for students of IIT Gandhinagar that creates automatic reminders for returning library books on time.

I built this app in my Junior year for the students of IIT Gandhinagar. I realized that many of us including me would forget to return our library books on time and consequently shell out money as late fees. So, I built this app which just required an IITGN student to put in the roll no and the app would automatically sync all the books issued and create a reminder when the books are due. The app was hosted on college's local server.
